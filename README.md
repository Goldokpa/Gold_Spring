- Whenever you push your updates, please create a PR and tag all team members so it can be reviewed before being merged to the **master** branch.
- For all PRs, please provide a summary of what was worked on/ the features in the PR.
- If there are any questions or feedback, please leave them as comments on the PR.
- Please ensure to always pull all updates from the **master** branch before creating your new branch locally and working with it.
