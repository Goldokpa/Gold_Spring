## Initial Tasks/Things to Note

- Clone the repo
- Always create a new branch for your work, and any updates you want to make should be pushed to the branch. For ease, branches can be named with the format: ***your_name/feature_you_worked_on***
- The **main** branch cannot be protected for unintentional pushes because the repo is private and this is not an organisation account. Hence, please ensure you **DO NOT** push directly to the **main** branch.
- To push your updates, please follow the **branch creation step**, then **create a PR** and tag all team members so it can be reviewed before being merged to the **main** branch.
- For all PRs, please provide a summary of what was worked on/ the features in the PR.
- If there are any questions or feedback, please leave them as comments on the PR.
- Please ensure to always pull all updates from the **master** branch before creating your new branch locally and working with it.
- **To be continued...**

Feel free to add more highlights to help us all work better together.
